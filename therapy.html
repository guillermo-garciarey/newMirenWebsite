							<h3>Trauma - Healing from the Past</h3>
							<p>
								Trauma isn’t just about what happened, it’s about how it affects
								you. Whether from childhood experiences, abuse, accidents, or
								sudden loss, trauma can deeply impact emotions, behaviors, and
								even physical health.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Flashbacks, nightmares, or intrusive thoughts</li>
								<li>Emotional numbness or difficulty trusting others</li>
								<li>Anxiety, panic attacks, or chronic stress</li>
								<li>Feeling "stuck" in the past</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>How Therapy Can Help</strong></p>
							<p>
								Trauma therapy focuses on understanding and processing past
								experiences in a safe, structured way. Modalities like EMDR,
								CBT, and mindfulness-based approaches can help reframe
								distressing memories, reduce symptoms, and rebuild a sense of
								safety and self-trust.

							<h3>Relationship Issues - Building Healthy Connections</h3>
							<p>
								Relationships shape our lives—from family bonds to romantic
								partnerships to friendships and workplace dynamics. When they
								are strained, it can cause emotional distress and affect
								self-worth.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Communication breakdowns and misunderstandings</li>
								<li>Codependency or difficulty setting boundaries</li>
								<li>Trust issues due to past betrayals or conflicts</li>
								<li>Emotional disconnect or recurring unhealthy patterns</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>How Therapy Can Help</strong></p>
							<p>
								Therapy provides a space to explore patterns, improve
								communication, and establish healthier dynamics. Whether you're
								working on a romantic relationship, navigating family tensions,
								or struggling with loneliness, therapy can offer insight and
								strategies for stronger connections.

							<h3>Personal Development - Unlocking Your Potential</h3>
							<p>
								Many people come to therapy not because of crisis, but because
								they feel stuck, unfulfilled, or uncertain about their direction
								in life.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>A lack of motivation or direction</li>
								<li>Fear of failure or perfectionism</li>
								<li>Low confidence or imposter syndrome</li>
								<li>Struggles with decision-making</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>How Therapy Can Help</strong></p>
							<p>
								Through self-exploration, goal setting, and practical tools,
								therapy can help you move forward with clarity and confidence.
								Whether it’s career decisions, creative pursuits, or personal
								fulfillment, we work together to create lasting, meaningful
								change.

							<h3>Depression - Finding Light in the Darkness</h3>
							<p>
								Depression isn’t just sadness—it’s a persistent feeling of
								emptiness, exhaustion, or disconnection. It can drain joy from
								everyday life, making even simple tasks feel overwhelming.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Lack of motivation, energy, or concentration</li>
								<li>Persistent sadness, numbness, or irritability</li>
								<li>Withdrawal from loved ones and activities</li>
								<li>Sleep disturbances and changes in appetite</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>How Therapy Can Help</strong></p>
							<p>
								Therapy provides a supportive space to explore underlying
								causes, challenge negative thought patterns, and develop coping
								strategies. Approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
								and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can help you regain
								a sense of purpose and engagement with life.

							<h3>Self-Esteem - Rebuilding Confidence</h3>
							<p>
								Self-esteem is how we perceive ourselves—it influences every
								choice we make and every relationship we build. Low self-esteem
								can hold us back, making us doubt our worth and abilities.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Persistent self-doubt or harsh self-criticism</li>
								<li>Comparing yourself negatively to others</li>
								<li>Difficulty accepting compliments or successes</li>
								<li>Fear of judgment or failure</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>How Therapy Can Help</strong></p>
							<p>
								Therapy helps uncover and challenge deep-seated self-beliefs,
								fostering self-compassion and confidence. Through guided
								self-reflection and behavioral strategies, we work on building a
								strong and empowered self-image.

							<h3>Stress Management - Finding Balance in a Busy World</h3>
							<p>
								Stress is a normal part of life, but when it becomes chronic, it
								can take a toll on mental and physical health.
							</p>
							<p><strong>Common Challenges:</strong></p>
							<ul>
