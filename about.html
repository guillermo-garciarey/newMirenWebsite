							<h2>My Journey Into Therapy</h2>
							<p>
								Therapy, to me, is more than just a profession, it’s a calling
								that grew from my deep curiosity about people, emotions, and the
								ways we make sense of our experiences. From a young age, I was
								drawn to understanding what drives us, why we sometimes feel
								stuck, and how we can heal from the past. This curiosity led me
								down a path of learning, self-reflection, and ultimately, into
								the work I do today.

								<br />
								<br />
								Throughout my journey, I’ve had the privilege of working with
								individuals from all walks of life, each with their own unique
								struggles and strengths. I’ve witnessed firsthand how powerful
								it can be to have a space where you feel truly seen and heard, a
								space where you can explore your thoughts, emotions, and
								patterns without fear of judgment. I firmly believe that healing
								happens in connection, and my role as a therapist is to create a
								safe, compassionate, and supportive environment where you can
								grow in a way that feels right for you.

								<br />
								<br />Whether you're navigating anxiety, depression, self-doubt,
								or the impact of past experiences, I’m here to help you make
								sense of your emotions, uncover deeper insights about yourself,
								and find practical ways to move forward. My work is grounded in
								the belief that therapy should be a collaborative and empowering
								process, one that helps you not only manage challenges but also
								reconnect with your inner strength and potential. <br /><br />
							</p>

							<p>
								If you’re feeling lost, overwhelmed, or simply ready for change,
								know that you don’t have to figure it all out alone.

						I draw from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Psychodynamic
						Therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Techniques, blending practical tools
						with deep self-exploration to create meaningful change. I am also
						passionate about ongoing learning and growth, and I am currently
						pursuing an MA in Trauma and Attachment. This focus allows me to
						integrate the latest research on how early experiences shape our
						emotions, behaviors, and relationships—insights that I weave into
						therapy to help my clients build healthier, more fulfilling lives.
					</p>

					<p>
						At the moment I exclusively work with adults facing a range of
						difficulties, from anxiety and depression to struggles with
						self-worth, past trauma, and relationship challenges. Life
						transitions—whether planned or unexpected—can stir up deep emotions,
						uncertainty, and stress, and I am here to help you find clarity,
						resilience, and a sense of direction. Whether you're feeling stuck
						in unhelpful patterns, seeking to understand yourself on a deeper
						level, or looking for tools to manage overwhelming emotions, I will
						meet you where you are and support you in moving forward.

							Over the last seven years I have had two back surgeries on the
							same L4/L5 disc. I have been going to Vivienne since December 2016
							due to back spasm and being in a situation where I could not do
							any strength or physical training without my back going into
							spasm. Vivienne assessed my injury on the first day and gave me
							confidence that she would be able to help me. I haven’t had back
							spasms in three months and I am now running for the first time in
							seven years. This is all down to Vivienne. Her expert knowledge
							and clear passion for her work is evident in her approach.

							I went to see Vivienne for a shoulder injury which Vivienne helped
							to clear up in a matter of weeks. I found Vivienne to be very
							professional, knowledgeable and passionate about her work and put
							my mind at ease from the first session. The exercises that
							Vivienne provided were easy to follow and she was always on hand
							to answer any questions. I would highly recommend Vivienne for
							helping with any type of injury
